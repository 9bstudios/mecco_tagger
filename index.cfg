  - I often create Alphas for each of my material tags (e.g. Wood, Fabric, etc.).  Would be great to see a more efficient way of creating Alpha outputs in Tagger.

Carson Jones
  - Also I often use Item masks for Alphas and it would be very useful to have a faster way of doing this. As an example, it would be great if we could create an Item mask that only contains an Alpha output.  Currently I create the Item mask, then create an Alpha output, and then delete the material that's automatically created in the Item mask.
