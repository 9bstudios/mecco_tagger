      <h1>Tagger Help</h1>
      <p>Tagger is a collection of tools for managing polygon tags and material assignments in MODO.</p>

      <h3>What are pTags?</h3>
      <p>Materials in MODO are assigned using "polygon tags" (pTags). Each polygon in a mesh is assigned a little chunk of text that--put simplisticly--tell MODO what material mask to use when shading said polygon.</p>
      <p>Assigning materials this way is very flexible, because each polygon in a mesh can have its own material assignment. It's also inherently heavy and slow, since each and every polygon in the mesh has a little string of text attached to it. For very dense meshes (like CAD imports), this can become prohibitively heavy.</p>

      <h3>Types of pTags</h3>
      <p>There are three kinds of polygon tags in MODO: material tags, part tags, and pick tags (aka selection sets).</p>
      <p><strong>Material tags</strong> are typically used for material filtering in the shader tree. A given poly may only have one Material tag at a time.</p>
      <p><strong>Pick tags</strong> are the internal name for "selection sets", allowing the user to quickly save and recall polygon selections. Pick tags are unique because each tag is actually a semi-colon delimited list of individual tags, allowing a given polygon to have as many pick tags as needed. Since a polygon can have any number of pick tags, they can be very useful for complex layered material filtering.</p>
      <p><strong>Part tags</strong> are commonly used for storing extra information about polygons, especially during import from a third-party format. In CAD imports, for example, Part tags are used to demark individual CAD faces from the original NURBS data. Most users are unaware this data exists, but it can be invaluable when working with CAD data. A given polygon may only have one Part tag at a time.</p>
